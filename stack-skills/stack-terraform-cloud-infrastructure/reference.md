# Terraform: Cloud and infrastructure security

Stack-specific implementation for **Terraform** (Infrastructure). Normative rules: domain skill `security-cloud-infrastructure` / `reference.md`.

## Cloud IAM

**Sub-topics:** Overprivileged roles, IAM conditions, Threat modeling and trust boundaries (Cloud IAM), Abuse cases and adversarial testing (Cloud IAM), Logging, audit, and detection (Cloud IAM)

### Do (use this in Terraform)

- Map `Cloud IAM` controls to Terraform APIs documented for `security-cloud-infrastructure`.
- Add an abuse-case test or check for `Cloud IAM` before merge.

### Don't

- Do not ship `Cloud IAM` work in Terraform with only happy-path tests.
- Do not disable Terraform security defaults to unblock `Cloud IAM`.

### Verify

- Peer review `Cloud IAM` against domain skill `security-cloud-infrastructure`.

**Sub-topics:** Public ACLs, Policy mistakes, Threat modeling and trust boundaries (Object storage buckets), Abuse cases and adversarial testing (Object storage buckets), Logging, audit, and detection (Object storage buckets)

### Do (use this in Terraform)

- Pin module versions; store state in encrypted remote backend.
- Use `terraform plan` in CI with policy checks.

### Don't

- Do not commit `terraform.tfstate` with secrets.
- Do not use `0.0.0.0/0` security groups without review.
