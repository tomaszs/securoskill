# Terraform: Real-time, WebSocket, and messaging

Stack-specific implementation for **Terraform** (Infrastructure). Normative rules: domain skill `security-realtime-messaging` / `reference.md`.

## WebSocket authentication

**Sub-topics:** Cookie vs token, Reconnect, Threat modeling and trust boundaries (WebSocket authentication), Abuse cases and adversarial testing (WebSocket authentication), Logging, audit, and detection (WebSocket authentication)

### Do (use this in Terraform)

- Pin module versions; store state in encrypted remote backend.
- Use `terraform plan` in CI with policy checks.

### Don't

- Do not commit `terraform.tfstate` with secrets.
- Do not use `0.0.0.0/0` security groups without review.

### Verify

- tfsec/checkov on every PR.

## Room and channel authorization

**Sub-topics:** Join tokens, Threat modeling and trust boundaries (Room and channel authorization), Abuse cases and adversarial testing (Room and channel authorization), Logging, audit, and detection (Room and channel authorization), Access control and least privilege (Room and channel authorization)

### Do (use this in Terraform)

- Check authorization on every handler after authentication (object-level, not only route-level).
- Centralize policy checks; reuse one guard/middleware pattern across routes.

### Don't

- Do not trust client-sent role flags or hidden form fields for authorization.
- Do not skip authz on 'internal' JSON endpoints.

### Verify

- Add tests for horizontal IDOR (user A cannot access user B ids).
