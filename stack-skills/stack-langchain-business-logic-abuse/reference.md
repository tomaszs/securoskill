# LangChain / LangGraph: Business logic and abuse prevention

Stack-specific implementation for **LangChain / LangGraph** (AI). Normative rules: domain skill `security-business-logic-abuse` / `reference.md`.

## Payment and checkout abuse

**Sub-topics:** Coupon stacking, Currency, Threat modeling and trust boundaries (Payment and checkout abuse), Abuse cases and adversarial testing (Payment and checkout abuse), Logging, audit, and detection (Payment and checkout abuse)

### Do (use this in LangChain / LangGraph)

- Treat retrieved documents and tool outputs as untrusted; delimit and label untrusted blocks in prompts.
- Allowlist tools; validate JSON arguments with a strict schema before execution.
- Run privileged tools with service accounts scoped to the requesting user/tenant.

### Don't

- Do not pass raw user chat text directly into system prompts without separation.
- Do not give models shell, SQL, or HTTP tools without path/host allowlists.

### Verify

- Red-team with indirect injection samples in RAG fixtures.

## Workflow bypass

**Sub-topics:** State machine skips, Threat modeling and trust boundaries (Workflow bypass), Abuse cases and adversarial testing (Workflow bypass), Logging, audit, and detection (Workflow bypass), Access control and least privilege (Workflow bypass)
