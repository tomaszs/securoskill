# LangChain / LangGraph: Zero trust and secure access

Stack-specific implementation for **LangChain / LangGraph** (AI). Normative rules: domain skill `security-zero-trust-access` / `reference.md`.

## Zero trust principles

**Sub-topics:** Never trust network, Explicit verify, Least privilege session, Assume breach, Continuous validation

### Do (use this in LangChain / LangGraph)

- Treat retrieved documents and tool outputs as untrusted; delimit and label untrusted blocks in prompts.
- Allowlist tools; validate JSON arguments with a strict schema before execution.
- Run privileged tools with service accounts scoped to the requesting user/tenant.

### Don't

- Do not pass raw user chat text directly into system prompts without separation.
- Do not give models shell, SQL, or HTTP tools without path/host allowlists.

### Verify

- Red-team with indirect injection samples in RAG fixtures.
