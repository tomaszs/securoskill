# OpenAI API / Agents SDK: Backend and server-side security

Stack-specific implementation for **OpenAI API / Agents SDK** (AI). Normative rules: domain skill `security-backend-server` / `reference.md`.

## Injection (SQL, NoSQL, command, LDAP, template)

**Sub-topics:** SQL injection, ORM raw queries, Shell invocation, Server-side template injection, XPath and LDAP

### Do (use this in OpenAI API / Agents SDK)

- Use parameterized queries or ORM equivalents for every database call.

### Don't

- Do not build SQL/command strings with user input.

### Verify

- Static analysis for injection sinks.

## Server-side authorization

**Sub-topics:** RBAC, ABAC, Object-level checks, Admin routes, Threat modeling and trust boundaries (Server-side authorization)

### Do (use this in OpenAI API / Agents SDK)

- Use Structured Outputs / JSON schema for tool parameters.
- Set per-user rate limits and `max_tokens` ceilings in API gateway.

### Don't

- Do not send API keys to browsers; proxy via your backend.
- Do not auto-run tool results that contain `rm`, `DROP`, or `curl` without approval.

### Verify

- Log prompt injections attempts; alert on repeated jailbreak patterns.
