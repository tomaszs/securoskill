# LangChain / LangGraph: Backend and server-side security

Stack-specific implementation for **LangChain / LangGraph** (AI). Normative rules: domain skill `security-backend-server` / `reference.md`.

## Injection (SQL, NoSQL, command, LDAP, template)

**Sub-topics:** SQL injection, ORM raw queries, Shell invocation, Server-side template injection, XPath and LDAP

### Do (use this in LangChain / LangGraph)

- Use parameterized queries or ORM equivalents for every database call.

### Don't

- Do not build SQL/command strings with user input.

### Verify

- Static analysis for injection sinks.

## Server-side authorization

**Sub-topics:** RBAC, ABAC, Object-level checks, Admin routes, Threat modeling and trust boundaries (Server-side authorization)

### Do (use this in LangChain / LangGraph)

- Check authorization on every handler after authentication (object-level, not only route-level).
- Centralize policy checks; reuse one guard/middleware pattern across routes.

### Don't

- Do not trust client-sent role flags or hidden form fields for authorization.
- Do not skip authz on 'internal' JSON endpoints.

### Verify

- Add tests for horizontal IDOR (user A cannot access user B ids).

## Session management on server

**Sub-topics:** Session fixation, Rotation, Idle timeout, Concurrent sessions, Threat modeling and trust boundaries (Session management on server)

### Do (use this in LangChain / LangGraph)

- Treat retrieved documents and tool outputs as untrusted; delimit and label untrusted blocks in prompts.
- Allowlist tools; validate JSON arguments with a strict schema before execution.
- Run privileged tools with service accounts scoped to the requesting user/tenant.

### Don't

- Do not pass raw user chat text directly into system prompts without separation.
- Do not give models shell, SQL, or HTTP tools without path/host allowlists.

### Verify

- Red-team with indirect injection samples in RAG fixtures.

## Error handling and information disclosure

**Sub-topics:** Stack traces, Debug endpoints, Verbose validation errors, Threat modeling and trust boundaries (Error handling and information disclosure), Abuse cases and adversarial testing (Error handling and information disclosure)

### Do (use this in LangChain / LangGraph)
